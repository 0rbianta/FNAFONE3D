# FNAFONE3D-GAME
 3D Version Of Popular FNAF (Open Source & License-Free) Horror Game Made With Unity

 In fact, it is not a complete project. According to my plan It was a commercial project and I were plannin to sell it. However, with FNAF owners copyright permissions It went wrong. I force the limits and talked with some authorities of Clickteam LLC because it was a very big and future calming project. After that I came to the conclusion that I could not publish my game commercially. As a result, I added the last features that need to be added to the game quickly and shared it publicly in an open source way. Enjoy it! If there are new features you would like added, please contribute to our open source shared project. Help/support is done through our Discord server.
